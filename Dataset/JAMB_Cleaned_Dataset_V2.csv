Dont wait until its too close to the exam before you take it seriously. Focus on understanding your subjects, especially the ones youre not strong in, and practice past questions regularly. Also, get familiar with the CBT system so youre not confused on the exam day. Its normal to feel nervous, but dont let fear control you. Trust in your preparation, stay focused, and put your confidence in God. With steady effort and the right mindset, youll be fine."
