# Investigating JAMB Failure Rates and Predicting Future Performance Trends (2020â€“2030) in Nigeria
The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination is a critical gateway to tertiary education in Nigeria. Over the past five years (2020-2025), a concerning increase in student failure rates has been observed. This project aimed to thoroughly investigate the root causes of this trend through data-driven research and analysis. Utilizing survey data collected from JAMB candidates, we performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key influencing factors across demographics, study habits, resource access, and socio-economic backgrounds.
